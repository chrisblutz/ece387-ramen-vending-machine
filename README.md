# ECE387 Group Project - Ramen Vending Machine
## Group Members:

## Project
Our project is to create a prototype ramen noodle vending machine. This prototype will simulate boiling water to cook noodles and dispensing flavor powder.
The user can select a blend of different flavors or one flavor of varrying strength. There will be an interface such as a keypad for the user to specify their desired aspects of the ramen.
Due to safety and time concerns, heating of water will be simulated in some way until much further in development.

## Stretch Goals
The following will be implemented as additional features if time allows
- NFC Card reader to act as a payment method
- Dispenser for toppings other than seasonings such as onions, sesame seeds, etc.
- Actual water heating element
